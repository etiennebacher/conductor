# conductor 0.1.1.9000

* Methods `isActive()`, `getCurrentStep()` and `getHighlightedElement()` now work
  correctly ([#13](https://github.com/etiennebacher/conductor/issues/13)).

* Using step events `onShow` and `onHide` no longer hides progress indicators
  shown with `progress = TRUE` in `$new()` ([#114](https://github.com/etiennebacher/conductor/issues/114)).


# conductor 0.1.1

* `conductor` now scrolls smoothly between elements ([#19](https://github.com/etiennebacher/conductor/issues/19)).
* Update `shepherd.js` to v.10.0.1
* Method `isCentered()` is no longer supported because it was removed in
  `shepherd.js` v.10.0.0.

# conductor 0.1.0

* Initial version
